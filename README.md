# Assignment 4 - Design, Develop and Deploy a Working Website Meeting Product Owner Requirements

## Objectives
1. Each team will demonstrate the ability to be an actively engaged in a development project.
2. Team demonstrates requirements elicitation for a web project.
3. Team demonstrates effective development and management of a project backlog.
4. Team demonstrates the ability to create and manage a release plan for a working website.
5. Team members work with the product owner to prioritize the project backlog.
6. Team delivers effective regular product owner demonstrations and project retrospectives and sprint planning.
7. Team delivers and executes a comprehensive test plan for each sprint.
8. Team creates an effective data model that meets the requirements of the project.
9. Team effectively manages the code being developed by all team members using Git  and Github code version control facilities.
10. Team deploys a working application to test and development instances. All product demonstrations of new features occur from the remote server instance.

## Approach
Teams of up to 5 students will form early in class and will be assigned a project to deliver.  The instructor will play the role of the product owner of this project and will provide students with background information for the project and some of the initial requirements in a written document. Students are invited each week to interact with the product during Web Development Project time.  This will include time to conduct a weekly stand up meeting and time to ask the product owner questions each week. Outside of class, students can post additional questions and updates on a team discussion board.

## Deliverables
1. Statement of Work (SOW) which describes what features will be delivered by the team for this project. See the example of a Capstone SOW for details.
2. Data model for the application. This can be displayed using Oracle Data Modeler or Table descriptions with keys and foreign keys described. 
3. Detailed application mock-ups will be delivered for each sprint to provide a sign off for each of the features delivered during the subsequent sprint. 
4. Documentation
   1. User/Administrator Manual – This includes an overview the business functions as well as detailed training for the user and administrator of the application your team has delivered.
   2. Technical manual – This explains how this application must be managed on an ongoing basis and installed in a new instance.
5. Project test plan and results of all test runs as well as bugs identified in the testing of this project. Defects should be tracked in GitHub.
6. Functioning web application that meets requirements of the product owner. More features are added during each sprint and demonstrated at the Sprint Demonstration at the end of each sprint. 
7. Each student will provide a peer review of each team member 4 times during the semester.
8. Each student will deliver a reflection for each sprint.
9. Team Lessons learned document.

## Rubrics
### Sprint Demonstrations
1. The Sprint product prototype demos will occur at the conclusion of each sprint including Sprint 0 (approximately every three weeks). The primary deliverable of Sprint 0 is the Statement of Work ready for signing, a release plan including the anticipated featured to be delivered during each of the subsequent sprints and mock-up for what will be delivered in Sprint 1.
2. During Sprint 1, the team will deliver the first set of working code running on the production server and run through all the features of this first set of working code. The team will also demonstrate the mockups, features/stories of what they plan to deliver in the next sprint. Burn down charts should also be reviewed during each sprint demo.
3. Each subsequent sprint then follows the demonstration of deliverables for each sprint and the review of what will be delivered in the next sprint. During the later sprints, technical and user documentation should be a part of the demonstration.
